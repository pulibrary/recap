General Information
-------------------

This module provides an integration between the Juicebox HTML5 responsive 
gallery library (http://juicebox.net/) and Drupal. Juicebox is in many ways the
successor of Simpleviewer and offers a powerful and flexible image gallery 
front-end.

The Juicebox library is downloaded, maintained and supported totally
independently from this Drupal project. Both the Lite (free) and Pro versions
should work fine with this module, and the one you choose will depend largely on
how much formatting flexibly you require.

Please see the Drupal project page for a detailed feature overview:
